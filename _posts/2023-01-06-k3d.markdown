k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker. k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.

# Installation
It is very easy to install k3d. Just make sure to have a VM with docker and kubectl installed, then run a simple installation script. Installation is done in around 10 seconds
## Install prerequisites
### VM with docker
Prepare a VM with docker. (Not sure if it works well also on LXC instead of VM - but running pods in a kubernetes cluster in a container in a container... seems to be pushing it bit to far? Got some errors when trying)

### Install kubectl
See [Install and setup kubectl on linux](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).
* Download and check:
```shell
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"
echo "$(cat kubectl.sha256)  kubectl" | sha256sum --check
```
* Install and check:
```shell
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
kubectl version --client --output=yaml    
```

## Install k3d
See [k3d.io](https://k3d.io/)
* Download and install:
```shell
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash
```

# Create a cluster
```shell
k3d cluster create mycluster
```
Verify that cluster node is up
```shell
kubectl get nodes
```
Expected response:
```
NAME                     STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
k3d-mycluster-server-0   Ready    control-plane,master   12s   v1.24.4+k3s1
```

# Try out some basics in the cluster
Start a single instance of nginx
```shell
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
```
create a Job which prints "Hello World"
```shell
kubectl create job hello --image=busybox:1.28 -- echo "Hello World"
```
Check running pods, deployments etc.
```shell
kubectl get all
```

# Delete a cluster
```shell
k3d cluster delete mycluster
```
Verify that cluster node is up
```shell
kubectl get nodes
```
Expected response: error: the server doesn't have a resource type "nodes"
